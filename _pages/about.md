I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Virginia Tech University. I am advised by Prof. Bo Ji. 

My research interests broadly fall within the areas of system security and privacy, specifically on emerging computing platforms and complex systems, including Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded devices.
