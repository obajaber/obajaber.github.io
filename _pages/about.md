I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Virginia Tech. I am advised by [Prof. Bo Ji](https://people.cs.vt.edu/boji/). 

My research interests broadly fall within the areas of system security and privacy, specifically on emerging computing platforms and complex systems, including Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded devices.
