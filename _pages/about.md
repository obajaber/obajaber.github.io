I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Virginia Tech, advised by [Prof. Bo Ji](https://people.cs.vt.edu/boji/) and [Prof.  Peng Gao](https://people.cs.vt.edu/penggao/). My research interests broadly fall within the areas of system security and privacy, specifically on emerging computing platforms and complex systems, including recently proposed programmable switches and SmartNICs. Building upon this, I am particularly driven to develop secure, scalable, and intelligent primitives embedded within the network infrastructure, enhancing its security and robustness.
